# Atom Bubblegum Light Syntax

An Atom syntax theme with delicious bubblegum colors.

It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

Inspired by the syntax theme [in this blog post](http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html).
