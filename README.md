# Atom Bubblegum Syntax

An Atom syntax theme with delicious bubblegum colors.

It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

## Language support

Why is the language support somewhat sparse? In order to decide how a language should be highlighted, it's helpful to understand the language. Only then you can get the nuances right. Therefore this theme only supports a language if somebody actively maintains it.

## Contribute

Want to contribute? Awesome! Here the steps to add syntax highlighting for a specific language:

1. Add an example file to `spec/`. Doesn't have to be complete, just something to test the highlighting.
2. Add a Less file with the styling to `styles/languages/`.
3. Add an import to that Less file in `styles/languages/_index.less`.
4. Add yourself as the maintainer to this `README.md`.
5. Make a PR. :tada:

> Note: Since there are hundreds (thousands?) of languages out there, less commonly used languages might not get accepted. :bow:
